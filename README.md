## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started
Clone the repository or click the download button.
open
```
index.html
```
from there click on "Cam's Pizzeria"

#### Part 1: Increasing Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html
- Put this on a server to get the insights so I used gitHub pages to get a score
- Inlined CSS
- compressed, localized, and resized photos using GIMP
- used the async attribute on the script tags

#### Part 2: Optimized for a consistent 60 Frames per Second in pizza.html
- fixed some of the forced reflow that was happening when resizing the pizzas
- decreased the number of pizzas in the background andrefactored some of the code involved to get a crisp and smooth scroll

I used some of these tips below

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.
